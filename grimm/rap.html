    Once upon a time there was a man and a woman who had long,<br>
    but to no avail,<br>
    wished for a child.<br>
    Finally the woman came to believe that the good Lord would fulfill her wish.<br>
    Through the small rear window of these people's house<br>
    they could see into a splendid garden<br>
    that was filled with the most beautiful flowers and herbs.<br>
    The garden was surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared enter,<br>
    because it belonged to a sorceress who possessed great power <br>
    and was feared by everyone.<br>
    One day the woman was standing at this window, and she saw a bed planted<br>
    with the most beautiful rapunzel.<br>
    It looked so fresh and green that she longed for some.<br>
    It was her greatest desire to eat some of the rapunzel.<br>
    This desire increased with every day,<br>
    and not knowing how to get any, she became miserably ill.<br>
    Her husband was frightened, and asked her, "What ails you, dear wife?"<br>
    "Oh," she answered,<br>
    "if I do not get some rapunzel from the garden behind our house, I shall die."<br>
    The man, who loved her dearly, thought,<br>
    "Before you let your wife die, you must get her some of the rapunzel,<br>
    whatever the cost."<br>
    So just as it was getting dark he climbed over the high wall<br>
    into the sorceress's garden,<br>
    hastily dug up a handful of rapunzel, and took it to his wife.<br>
    She immediately made a salad from it, which she devoured eagerly.<br>
    It tasted so very good to her that <br>
    by the next day her desire for more had grown threefold.<br>
    If she were to have any peace,<br>
    the man would have to climb into the garden once again.<br>
    Thus he set forth once again just as it was getting dark.<br>
    But no sooner than he had climbed over the wall than,<br>
    to his horror,<br>
    he saw the sorceress standing there before him.<br>
    "How can you dare," she asked with an angry look,<br>
    "to climb into my garden and like a thief to steal my rapunzel? <br>
    You will pay for this."<br>
    "Oh," he answered,<br>
    "Let mercy overrule justice.<br>
    I came to do this out of necessity.<br>
    My wife saw your rapunzel from our window,<br>
    and such a longing came over her, that she would die,<br>
    if she did not get some to eat."<br>
    The sorceress's anger abated somewhat, and she said,<br>
    "If things are as you say,<br>
    I will allow you to take as much rapunzel as you want.<br>
    But under one condition:<br>
    You must give me the child that your wife will bring to the world.<br>
    It will do well, and I will take care of it like a mother."<br>
    In his fear the man agreed to everything.<br>
    When the woman gave birth, the sorceress appeared,<br>
    named the little girl Rapunzel, and took her away.<br>
    Rapunzel became the most beautiful child under the sun.<br>
    When she was twelve years old,<br>
    the sorceress locked her in a tower that stood in a forest<br>
    and that had neither a door nor a stairway,<br>
    but only a tiny little window at the very top.<br>
    When the sorceress wanted to enter, she stood below and called out:<br>
    Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br>
    Let down your hair to me.<br>
    Rapunzel had splendid long hair, as fine as spun gold.<br>
    When she heard the sorceress's voice,<br>
    she untied her braids,<br>
    wound them around a window hook,<br>
    let her hair fall twenty yards to the ground,<br>
    and the sorceress climbed up it.<br>
    A few years later it happened <br>
    that a king's son was riding through the forest.<br>
    As he approached the tower he heard a song so beautiful <br>
    that he stopped to listen.<br>
    It was Rapunzel, who was passing the time by singing with her sweet voice.<br>
    The prince wanted to climb up to her, and looked for a door in the tower,<br>
    but none was to be found.<br>
    He rode home,<br>
    but the song had so touched his heart that he returned to the forest every day<br>
    and listened to it.<br>
    One time, as he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw the sorceress approach,<br>
    and heard her say:<br>
    Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br>
    Let down your hair.<br>
    Then Rapunzel let down her strands of hair,<br>
    and the sorceress climbed up them to her.<br>
    "If that is the ladder into the tower, then sometime I will try my luck."<br>
    And the next day, just as it was beginning to get dark,<br>
    he went to the tower and called out:<br>
    Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br>
    Let down your hair.<br>
    The hair fell down, and the prince climbed up.<br>
    At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened<br>
    when a man such as she had never seen before came in to her.<br>
    However, the prince began talking to her in a very friendly manner,<br>
    telling her that his heart had been so touched by her singing<br>
    that he could have no peace until he had seen her in person.<br>
    Then Rapunzel lost her fear,<br>
    and when he asked her if she would take him as her husband,<br>
    she thought, "He would rather have me than would old Frau Gothel."<br>
    She said yes and placed her hand into his.<br>
    She said, "I would go with you gladly, but I do not know how to get down.<br>
    Every time that you come, bring a strand of silk,<br>
    from which I will weave a ladder.<br>
    When it is finished I will climb down,<br>
    and you can take me away on your horse."<br>
    They arranged that he would come to her every evening,<br>
    for the old woman came by day.<br>
    The sorceress did not notice what was happening<br>
    until one day Rapunzel said to her,<br>
    "Frau Gothel, tell me why it is that you are more difficult to pull up<br>
    than is the young prince, who will be arriving any moment now?"<br>
    "You godless child," cried the sorceress.<br>
    "What am I hearing from you?<br>
    I thought I had removed you from the whole world,<br>
    but you have deceived me nonetheless."<br>
    In her anger she grabbed Rapunzel's beautiful hair,<br>
    wrapped it a few times around her left hand,<br>
    grasped a pair of scissors with her right hand,<br>
    and snip snap, cut it off.<br>
    And she was so unmerciful<br>
    that she took Rapunzel into a wilderness where she suffered greatly.<br>
    On the evening of the same day<br>
    that she sent Rapunzel away,<br>
    the sorceress tied the cut-off hair to the hook at the top of the tower,<br>
    and when the prince called out:<br>
    Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br>
    Let down your hair.<br>
    she let down the hair.<br>
    The prince climbed up, but above,<br>
    instead of his beloved Rapunzel, he found the sorceress,<br>
    who peered at him with poisonous and evil looks.<br>
    "Aha!" she cried scornfully.<br>
    "You have come for your Mistress Darling,<br>
    but that beautiful bird is no longer sitting in her nest,<br>
    nor is she singing any more.<br>
    The cat got her, and will scratch your eyes out as well.<br>
    You have lost Rapunzel. You will never see her again."<br>
    The prince was overcome with grief,<br>
    and in his despair he threw himself from the tower.<br>
    He escaped with his life,<br>
    but the thorns into which he fell poked out his eyes.<br>
    Blind, he wandered about in the forest, eating nothing but grass and roots,<br>
    and doing nothing but weeping and wailing over the loss of his beloved wife.<br>
    Thus he wandered about miserably for some years,<br>
    finally happening into the wilderness<br>
    where Rapunzel lived miserably with the twins that she had given birth to.<br>
    He heard a voice and thought it was familiar.<br>
    He advanced toward it, and as he approached, Rapunzel recognized him,<br>
    and crying, threw her arms around his neck.<br>
    Two of her tears fell into his eyes,<br>
    and they became clear once again, and he could see as well as before.<br>
    He led her into his kingdom, where he was received with joy,<br>
    and for a long time they lived happily and satisfied.<br>
