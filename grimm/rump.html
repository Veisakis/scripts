      Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful<br>
      daughter.  Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the<br>
      king, and in order to make himself appear important he said<br>
      to him, I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.  The<br>
      king said to the miller, that is an art which<br>
      pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring<br>
      her to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test.<br>
      And when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room<br>
      which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a<br>
      reel, and said, now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning<br>
      early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night,<br>
      you must die.  Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and<br>
      left her in it alone.  So there sat the poor miller's daughter,<br>
      and for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no<br>
      idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and<br>
      more frightened, until at last she began to weep.<br>
      But all at once the door opened, and in came a little man,<br>
      and said, good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so.<br>
      Alas, answered the girl, I have to spin straw into gold, and I do<br>
      not know how to do it.  What will you give me, said the<br>
      manikin, if I do it for you.  My necklace, said the girl.  The<br>
      little man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the<br>
      wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was<br>
      full, then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times<br>
      round, and the second was full too.  And so it went on until<br>
      the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels<br>
      were full of gold.<br>
      By daybreak the king was already there, and<br>
      when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his<br>
      heart became only more greedy.  He had the miller's daughter<br>
      taken into another room full of straw, which was much larger,<br>
      and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued<br>
      her life.  The girl knew not how to help herself, and was<br>
      crying, when the door opened again, and the little man appeared,<br>
      and said, what will you give me if I spin that straw into gold<br>
      for you.  The ring on my finger, answered the girl.  The little<br>
      man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by<br>
      morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.<br>
      The king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had<br>
      not gold enough, and he had the miller's daughter taken into<br>
      a still larger room full of straw, and said, you must spin this,<br>
      too, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall<br>
      be my wife.<br>
      Even if she be a miller's daughter, thought he, I could not<br>
      find a richer wife in the whole world.<br>
      When the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third<br>
      time, and said, what will you give me if I spin the straw for<br>
      you this time also.  I have nothing left that I could give,<br>
      answered the girl.  Then promise me, if you should become queen,<br>
      to give me your first child.  Who knows whether that will<br>
      ever happen, thought the miller's daughter, and, not knowing<br>
      how else to help herself in this strait, she promised the<br>
      manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the<br>
      straw into gold.<br>
      And when the king came in the morning, and found all as he<br>
      had wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller's<br>
      daughter became a queen.<br>
      A year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world,<br>
      and she never gave a thought to the manikin.  But suddenly he<br>
      came into her room, and said, now give me what you promised.<br>
      The queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the<br>
      riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child.  But the<br>
      manikin said, no, something alive is dearer to me than all the<br>
      treasures in the world.  Then the queen began to lament and cry,<br>
      so that the manikin pitied her.  I will give you three days,<br>
      time, said he, if by that time you find out my name, then shall<br>
      you keep your child.<br>
      So the queen thought the whole night of all the names that<br>
      she had ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to<br>
      inquire, far and wide, for any other names that there might be.<br>
      When the manikin came the next day, she began with caspar,<br>
      melchior, balthazar, and said all the names she knew, one<br>
      after another, but to every one the little man said, that is not<br>
      my name.  On the second day she had inquiries made in the<br>
      neighborhood as to the names of the people there, and she<br>
      repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious.  Perhaps<br>
      your name is shortribs, or sheepshanks, or laceleg, but he<br>
      always answered, that is not my name.<br>
      On the third day the messenger came back again, and said, I<br>
      have not been able to find a single new name, but as I came to<br>
      a high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare<br>
      bid each other good night, there I saw a little house, and<br>
      before the house a fire was burning, and round about the fire<br>
      quite a ridiculous little man was jumping, he hopped upon<br>
      one leg, and shouted -<br>
              to-day I bake, to-morrow brew,<br>
              the next I'll have the young queen's child.<br>
              Ha, glad am I that no one knew<br>
              that Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.<br>
      You may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the<br>
      name.  And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and<br>
      asked, now, mistress queen, what is my name, at first she<br>
      said, is your name Conrad?  No.  Is your name Harry?  No.<br>
      Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?<br>
      The devil has told you that!  The devil has told you that, cried<br>
      the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so<br>
      deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in<br>
      rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that<br>
      he tore himself in two.<br>
