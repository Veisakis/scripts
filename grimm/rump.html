      <p>
      Once there was a miller who was poor, <br>
      but who had a beautiful daughter. <br>
      Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king and  <br>
      in order to make himself appear important he said to him, <br>
      <i>I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold. </i> <br>
      The king said to the miller, <br>
      <i>That is an art which pleases me well. <br>
      If your daughter is as clever as you say, <br>
      bring her tomorrow to my palace, <br>
      and I will put her to the test. </i> <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      And when the girl was brought to him <br>
      he took her into a room <br>
      which was quite full of straw, <br>
      gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel <br>
      and said, <br>
      <i> Now set to work, and <br>
      if by tomorrow morning early <br>
      you have not spun this straw into gold <br>
      during the night, you must die </i> <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      Thereupon he himself locked up the room, <br>
      and left her in it alone. <br>
      So there sat the poor miller's daughter, <br>
      and for the life of her <br>
      could not tell what to do, <br>
      she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, <br>
      and she grew more and more frightened, <br>
      until at last she began to weep. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      But all at once the door opened, <br>
      and in came a little man, and said <br>
      <i> Good evening, mistress miller, <br>
      why are you crying so? <br>
      Alas,</i> answered the girl, <br>
      <i> I have to spin straw into gold, <br>
      and I do not know how to do it. <br>
      What will you give me, </i> said the manikin <br>
      <i> If I do it for you. <br>
      My necklace, </i> said the girl. <br>
      The little man took the necklace, <br>
      seated himself in front of the wheel <br>
      and whirr, whirr, whirr, <br>
      three turns, and the reel was full <br>
      then he put another on, <br>
      and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round <br>
      and the second was full too. <br>
      And so it went on until the morning <br>
      when all the straw was spun, <br>
      and all the reels were full of gold. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      By daybreak the king was already there, <br>
      and when he saw the gold <br>
      he was astonished and delighted, <br>
      but his heart became only more greedy. <br>
      He had the miller's daughter <br>
      taken into another room full of straw, <br>
      which was much larger, <br>
      and commanded her to spin that also in one night <br>
      if she valued her life. <br>
      The girl knew not how to help herself and was crying <br>
      when the door opened again, <br>
      and the little man appeared, <br>
      and said, <br>
      <i> What will you give me <br>
      if I spin that straw into gold for you. <br>
      The ring on my finger, </i> answered the girl. <br>
      The little man took the ring, <br>
      again began to turn the wheel, <br>
      and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      The king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, <br>
      but still he had not gold enough, <br>
      and he had the miller's daughter taken <br>
      into a still larger room full of straw, and said, <br>
      <i> You must spin this too <br>
      in the course of this night, <br>
      but if you succeed, <br>
      you shall be my wife. </i> <br>
      Even if she be a miller's daughter, thought he, <br>
      I could not find a richer wife in the whole world. <br>
      When the girl was alone <br>
      the manikin came again for the third time, and said, <br>
      <i> What will you give me <br>
      if I spin the straw for you this time also. <br>
      I have nothing left that I could give, </i> <br>
      answered the girl. <br>
      <i> Then promise me, <br>
      if you should become queen, <br>
      to give me your first child. </i> <br>
      Who knows whether that will <br>
      ever happen, thought the miller's daughter, <br>
      and not knowing how else to help herself in this strait <br>
      she promised the manikin what he wanted <br>
      and for that <br>
      he once more spun the straw into gold. <br>
      And when the king came in the morning, <br>
      and found all as he had wished, <br>
      he took her in marriage, <br>
      and the pretty miller's daughter <br>
      became a queen. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
    <article class="center">
      <h4 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER II</h4>
      <p>
      A year after, <br>
      she brought a beautiful child into the world, <br>
      and she never gave a thought to the manikin. <br>
      But suddenly he came into her room, and said <br>
      <i> Now give me what you promised. </i> <br>
      The queen was horror-struck, <br>
      and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom <br>
      if he would leave her the child. <br>
      But the manikin said, <br>
      <i> No! <br>
      something alive is dearer to me <br>
      than all the treasures in the world. </i> <br>
      Then the queen began to lament and cry, <br>
      so that the manikin pitied her. <br>
      <i> I will give you three days time <br>
      said he <br>
      If by that time you find out my name, <br>
      then shall you keep your child. </i> <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      So the queen thought the whole night <br>
      of all the names that she had ever heard, <br>
      and she sent a messenger over the country to inquire <br>
      far and wide, <br>
      for any other names that there might be. <br>
      When the manikin came the next day, <br>
      she began with <br>
      <b> Caspar </b>  <br>
      <b> Melchior </b> <br>
      <b> Balthazar </b> <br>
      and said all the names she knew, <br>
      one after another, <br>
      but to every one the little man said, <br>
      that is not my name. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      On the second day <br>
      she had inquiries made in the neighborhood <br>
      as to the names of the people there, <br>
      and she repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious. <br>
      <i> Perhaps your name is <br>
      <b> Shortribs </b> <br>
      or <b> Sheepshanks </b> <br>
      or <b> Laceleg </b> </i> <br>
      but he always answered, <br>
      <i> That is not my name. </i> <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      On the third day <br>
      the messenger came back again, and said, <br>
      <i> I have not been able to find a single new name, <br>
      but as I came to a high mountain <br>
      at the end of the forest, <br>
      where the fox and the hare <br>
      bid each other good night, <br>
      there I saw a little house, <br>
      and before the house a fire was burning, <br>
      and round about the fire <br>
      quite a ridiculous little man was jumping, <br>
      he hopped upon one leg, and shouted <br>
      Today I bake, tomorrow brew, <br>
      the next I'll have the young queen's child. <br>
      Ha, glad am I that no one knew <br>
      that <b> Rumpelstiltskin </b> I am styled. </i> <br>
      You may imagine how glad the queen was <br>
      when she heard the name. <br>
      And when soon afterwards the little man came in <br>
      and asked, <br>
      <i> Now, mistress queen, what is my name, </i> <br>
      at first she said, <br>
      <i> Is your name <b> Conrad </b> ?  No. <br>
      Is your name <b> Harry </b> ?  No. <br>
      Perhaps your name is <b> Rumpelstiltskin </b> ? <br>
      The devil has told you that! <br>
      The devil has told you that, </i> <br>
      cried the little man, <br>
      and in his anger <br>
      he plunged his right foot <br>
      so deep into the earth <br>
      that his whole leg went in, <br>
      and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands <br>
      that he tore himself in two. <br>
